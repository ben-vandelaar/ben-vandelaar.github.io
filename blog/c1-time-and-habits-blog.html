    Q: which timebox and habits techniques did you try?<br>
        A: I'm trying really hard to build the habbit of the Pomodoro technique I do though at the moment often forget to set a goal. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Q: what did you find interesting?<br>
        A:That flow might be something you're able to control? Will need to look in to that more. I really only feel it when I'm playing guitar or working on my own projects. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Q: what worked for you?<br>
        A: Toggle is helping me keep track I somtimes finish my goal before the timer runs out and sometimes I go too deep down the rabbit hole. So I need to listen to <a href="https://vimeo.com/85001014">Shereef</a> and make sure I set a 
        new time stamp for this so not to spend 2hrs reading about "Canvas" in Js and tring to get it to work.
    </p>
    <p>
    Q:which will you experiment further with?<br>
        A: "Acknowledging your complexity" and listen more to Charles Duhigg to help me build some better habbits. Time to go buy some Chocolate!
