            <b>What a responsive site is, and why responsiveness is important.</b><br/>
            To be a responsive website the website needs to be able to adapt and change to every type of screen, this is important as with new technologies people are viewing your websites on a wider variety of devices.<br/> And if your website is not responsive and does't adapt itself to a persons device you have essentially lost yourself a customer.<br/>
            <br/>
            <b>What mobile first design is, and why it's important.</b><br/>
            It's all about conveying information. Mobile first means to start designing website or app with the smallest possible screen in mind.<br/> Designing like this will more clearly convey information and aid the customer with with having a more positive user experience when viewing your website on such a screen.<br/> It's also good to note with all the restrictions with the size and interaction with the mobile anything you design will easily work on a desktop this can't be said the other way around.<br/>
            <br/>
            <b>What frameworks are, and their pros and cons.</b><br/>
            Frame works are a pre-built css file that has a bunch of scripts designed to save you time when designing a website.<br/> They are good for the basic layouts and help in easily making elements such as images responsive but lack in any real detail often requiring you to have a second css file for when you want to actually start customising the website.<br/> They also lock you into a certain way of laying out your html and can sometimes break if not their rule set is not respected. <br/>
            <br/>
            <b>What a wireframe is and why we use it.</b><br/>
            Wire frame is essentially a mock up of the website I found a good reply to this and having just used my first "wireframe" can attest to is that wireframes tell us “What should go on this screen and in what general order” they help full the blank canvas and help keep us on track after each new function of img is added.<br/>
        </p>
            <br/>
            <b> Here are some of the wireframes I used in the design of my website.</b><br/>

            <b>The aspects of your wireframes you found difficult to implement, and why.</b> z<br/>
            I think my biggest difficulty at the moment is that I'm not 100% on the desing. I struggled a little with the gallery but also don't know if I want it there and if I want it so static. Though since I'm still learning I'll leave it like that for now and late turn that section in to a 'taster' linking to the real portfolio where I'd like to do something more creative.<br/>
