            <b>Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you:</b><br/>
            <ol>
                <li>Got blocked on a simple problem</li>
                <li>Solved a problem in an elegant way
                    In both cases:</li>
            </ol>
            <br/>
            <strong>What was the problem?</strong>
            <br/>
            It was during the 4.0 Free codecamp challange.. a few of those to be honest. But one of the ones that tripped me up was Basic JavaScript: Record Collection. 
            <br/>
            <b> What problem solving techniques did you use?</b><br/> 
               I tried everything... What I found helped most though was finding videos that described the subject <br/>matter in different ways and walk you through similar questions. I find that sometimes the hardest <br/>part of the question is actually figuring out what they want or what they're actually asking for.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <b>How did you feel throughout the process?.</b><br/>
                It could be a little stressfull felt like a comvaluted speed bump with this question. You sale down understanding everything answering the questions and then out of no where it's like "wait. what?" I found it important to write everthing down. Keep calm. Breath. And slowly figure it out. <br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <b>What did you learn?</b><br/>
                That I've still got a lot to learn and I'm getting there but it's a slightly different way of thinking. I've been making sure every now and again to sit down and read a book on coding, or watch a video or just something away from the sprints to try and get more programmer minded.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <b>Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process:</b><br/>
            <strong>Pseudocode:</strong>It's always good to re write out the question in a form of code and to break<br/> it down I a way that's easier to understand.<br/>
            <strong>Trying something:</strong> Coding is essential trial and error you should always try reload the <br/> page and see what happend. If it worked yay if not make notes on why not and try again. <br/>
            <strong> Rubber ducky method:</strong> Haven't tried this one too much. But maybe I should.. <br/>
            <strong> Reading error messages:</strong> This is a really good way to see what's happening under the  <br/>hood and then being able to make live changes to things to see how far out you were and know  <br/>exactly what lines of code are stopping your program from running.  <br/>
            <strong>Console.logging:</strong> This is a good way to see of your functions are running the way they  <br/>should. Passing a variable that you know the answer to and making sure that's what you get out. <br/>
            You can then test other areas of the functions and make sure what's being logged it correct. <br/>
            <strong>Googling:</strong> Sadly still my go to. Can save time and someone has normally asked the same <br/> question you have though sometimes the answers aren't the best. But it's normally a sure fire to see where you went wrong.  <br/>
            <strong>Asking your peers for help:</strong>At my old job when I was working in Python scripting small  <br/>tools for Maya there was always someone with a wealth of knowledge and understanding far beyond  <br/>mine around to help so asking a "Peer" was always the go to option for me. It help more I think  <br/>than the likes of google as you can pick the person's brain and ask more in depth questions and  <br/>actually get taught how to do it as opposed to just showing the answer. <br/>
            <strong>Improving your process with reflection:</strong> Reflection is key it gives you a chance to see <br/>where you struggled and how you struggled, then hopefully if you're still game find ways so you  <br/>don't struggle on the same kind of questions or areas again. This can be tricky as it's normally a  <br/>little deeper than just ah 2+2=4 it's more why does 2+2=4 and what about my way of thinking didn't  <br/>allow me to see that answer... If that makes sense..<br/>
