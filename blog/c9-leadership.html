            <b>What is your experience of compassionate (or not) leadership?</b><br/> 
            <br/>
            It's easier to thrive under a compassionate leader you feel connected to the project and motivated to do your best. I've had many companies/directors who see us as just another "brick in the wall" and once their done with us throw us away. 
            <br/>
            <b>Do the multiplying goodness meditation. How did you find it?</b><br/>
            It was nice, it's a nice feeling to multiply the "goodness".. I haven't thought of that before. A lot of meditation have you breath in "goodness" and breath out all the bad stuff. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <b>Do the Tonglen meditation. How did you find it?</b> <br/>
            <br/>
            Strong Will try add this to my daily meditations.<br/> 
            <br/>
            <b>How does the SCARF model apply to your Phase 0 experience so far? How will it apply to bootcamp?</b><br/> 
            <br/> 
            Status: This has been hard for me I think I put alot into having a good job and was proud of my job. I've found it hard to <br/> tell former work mates that I'm going back to study. But I need to remember that it's definitely not a step down in status.<br/> 
            <br/> 
            Certainty: Yeah in the past being a contract worker I felt uncertainty every time our contracts came up for review, it is <br/> debilitating. There is it feels a big leap of faith for me in this course and the career I'm heading in to. Every time I <br/> couldn't finish something or got stuck I doubted everything I was doing.. The meditation side of this course has helped, <br/> taking a breath focusing on goal and affirmations.<br/> 
            <br/> 
            Autonomy: This one I do feel in other areas of life but through slowing everything down and focusing of what needs to be <br/> done one step at a time is one way I've found helps with having some control in life.<br/> 
            <br/> 
            Relatedness: I really liked that quote they had in the book by Warren Buffett <i>"When you get to my age, you’ll measure <br/> your success in life by how many of the people you want to have love you actually do love you. That’s the ultimate test of <br/> how you’ve lived your life.”</i><br/> 
            <br/> 
            Fairness: Yeaah I find it hard not to be like everyone else and not take the one dollar and the end up with nothing.... <br/> Though I'm also the type of person who if I had the $20 dollars to try to be fair and give them $10 but will probably think<br/>  they deserve it more and give them the whole $20... I learning to make sure my decisions benefit me as well because how can<br/>  help anyone if I can't even help myself. It's been a learning process for me this year.. <br/> 
            <br/> 
            How am I going to apply this to the course. <br/> 
            Take the last chapter in account. Realise that everyone in this course is human and that we're all going through this in one <br/> way or another. Be empathetic and guide each other. <br/> 
            <br/> 
            <i>"Love them. Understand them. Forgive them. Grow with them."</i>
            <br/> 
            <br/> 
            <b>Have a difficult conversation. How did it go? (It's a valuable skill, but can take practice to develop!)</b><br/> 
            <br/> 
            I always have them haha you have to do it. The smallest things have ways of festering and manifesting into some horrible<br/>  monster. <br/> 
            <br/> 
            I do avoid having them and recently I've managed to catch my self and make sure I bite the bullet. It's the only way you can<br/>  get through anything in life and I do find that I regret not having the conversations more than having them. <br/>
