            <b>How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS?</b><br/>
            It's completely different. Html is a mark up language a "Scaffolding" or "Framing" for a house.<br/> CSS  is a perpose built script to effect the look and "style" of the HTML like the materials used in the constuction of the house.<br/> JavaScript is closer to the likes for C# or Python. It's the Gadgets around the house the wireing the plumbing maybe..<br/> But also exitsts indepentantly outside html and could very well be the as house unto itself.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <b>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'.</b><br/>
            It's hard now not to use the waking up example.<br/> But I think the gym could be a good example. You start of with a query to what the day of the week is, if today is a Monday Wednesday or Friday got to the gym else rest.<br/> Then at the gym create another statement to cycle through what area of your body you've worked on all ready this week, if has worked on arms work on legs else if work on chest and back else work on arms.<br/> Then you break it down to each machine or routine and turn them into loops, do number of repitions then break then repeat agian untill the number of sets has been met.   
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <b>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</b><br/>
            Arrays are sets of data which are stored in an ordered list.<br/> To access this data, you locate it by its specific numerical index starting from 0 to how many items are in the Array.<br/>
            <br/>
            Objects are different. They store data but in a less ordered manner. Each set of data has itâ€™s own properties and each propties can have more specific properties, ie in a list of animals a Cat has a name of Fluffy has a property of how many legs it has, likes fish and dislikes dogs and water.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <b>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</b><br/>
            Functions are blocks of code that can be called upon (repeatedly) to perform a certain task or "function". It can take arguments, manipulate arguments/set variables and/or return a variable.<br/> It helps make code easier to read and saves you from repeating yourself. They can also be kept in a seperate files to keep your file and script clean.
