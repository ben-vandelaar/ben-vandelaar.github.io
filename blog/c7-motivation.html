            <b>How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?</b>
            <br/>
                Good? I feel that's quite a Buddhist take on life or should I say a more mindfulness take on life.
            <br/>
            <b>What are your core values?</b><br/>
            I did a online test to help me it was hard, It made me choose 10 and then widdle it slowly down to 3..  <br/>
            Freedom <br/>
            Inner peace <br/>
            Adventure  <br/>
            Not Completely sure I think I need think about that one some more. <br/>
            <br/>
            <b>What do you stand for?</b> <br/>
            Will have to come back and re answer this one too I think I'll try the conversation one talk to someone about it.
            <br/>
            <b>How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?</b><br/> 
            I think the best thing to walk away with this one is <br/>
            <i>Let us see if we can create the ability to experience all those emotions without aversion.<br/>
                Consider these emotions you are experiencing as simply physiological sensations. That is all. They may be unpleasant, <br/>but they are simply experiences. Letâ€™s simply allow these experiences to be present, to come as they wish, <br/>and to go as they wish. Just let them be, in a kind, gentle, generous way.</i><br/>
            To learn not to have aversion to your "Failures" to learn that they're part of success and breaking through the box is <br/>something they need to start pushing in education in all areas of life really. I know a lot of very talented people who just <br/>wont push that bar because they're scared of failure and aways complain that they're life is going know where. It frustrates<br/>me and I relate to it because I'm often I that boat..<br/>
