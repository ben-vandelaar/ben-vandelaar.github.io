        Q: What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?
             A: That it's our own journey, our own experience to take a hold of. 
    
        Q: What are your impressions?
            A: Of what? The video seemed cool and very informative. I like the culture that EDA tries to breed and has tried to breed since the beginning. 
    
        Q: How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?
            A: Trying my best, ha! I think I'll be fine I sometimes struggle at speaking out and taking control sometimes but I've been getting better and it looks like it's safe and encouraged here.
    
        Q: Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?
            A: A little. I like the story on how it started. I was worried of taking too much control of my learning but I think it's going to be ok.
    
        Q: Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?
            A: It's going to be intense and I'm nervous and excited. Need to learn as much as I can!
