            <b>Have you tried using any of the insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity? How did it go?</b>
            <br/>

            <br/>
            <b> Try empathic listening - how did it go?</b><br/>
                It's hard, I like psychology and have a few family members who are psychologists. So I find it very hard not to  start“psychologizing”...<br/> But I think I'm getting better...<br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <b>How did you find the loving kindness meditation?</b> <br/>
            <br/>
                It's good. It works, it reminds me a little of the Hawaiian ho'oponopono. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <b>Complete the political awareness exercise here in writing.</b><br/> 
            <br/>
            1. Think of a difficult situation from your present or past, when there was some conflict or disagreement, something real, something that has some meaning and potency for you.<br/>
            <br/>
            This is hard.. I think the last time I actually argued for something and not just to show another point of view, was not too long ago I was working as a producer on a short film. The Director had got the 1st AD to come and tell me we will be dropping some of the breaks in order to make up to lost time... 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            2. Describe the situation as though you are 100 percent correct and reasonable. Do that either in writing or by talking about it in a monologue.<br/>
            <br/>
            There's no way I was going to allow that to happen even if certain members of the crew were ok with it. I told the director <br/>no. Why? Because 1. I have worked in positions like these and you normally just agree to work no break because you'd <br/>lose your job otherwise. 2. It's law. If people are working 8hr days they're initialed to 1hr rest. At least 15mins for <br/>morning tea 30mins for lunch and 15 for afternoon tea. This means also if anyone on our crew went home tired overworked<br/> and crashed, who gets the blame we do. And I'm pretty sure it's jail time. There were a few more reasons I <br/>argued it but I came down to the health and safety of the crew and saving mine and the directors asses. <br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            3. Now describe the situation as though the other person is (or the other people are) 100 percent correct and reasonable. Do <br/>that either in writing or by talking about it in a monologue.<br/>
            <br/>
            We needed to make up more time. Each shot each set up is taking waaay longer than we had anticipated. There's no quick <br/>insert shots, that's a 15min set up. I've already cut too many sequences out of the film and we really can't afford to <br/>make any more. We have to be done by Saturday we already need to change the lead actors flight times. The DOP said he's<br/> happy to work though to lunch since we're on a roll. And so does the 1st AD. <br/>  
            <br/>
            I know what the director was feeling. There was also the argument that having a break stops the flow and that takes a while<br/> to get started back up once it's gone. Which is true. A team of 16+ people, it takes a while to find the rhythm <br/>and to keep stopping and starting only hampers the progress. We came to a compromise I moved the 15min morning tea and<br/> combined it with lunch making it 45mins. I made sure to bring out food and drinks to people on set and make sure <br/>the communication between the crew is kept up so that if someone needed a break they could.<br/>
