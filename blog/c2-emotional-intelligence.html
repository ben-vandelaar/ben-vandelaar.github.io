        <h3>Search inside yourself</h3>
        <p>
            After reading the first chapter of the book written by Chad Meng Tan I'm definitely going to read the rest of the book. I showed me more that mindfulness is something that is starting to be valued in companies even as large as google. To have an engineer brake it down and take it out of the fluffy hippy realm is awesome and really resonates with me and is where "Mindfulness" needs to go in order for it to be picked up by the mainstream. It's also awesome that Meng shows how easy it is, 2mins a day everyday. Simple easy and no room for excuses. It's also interesting that he highlights that it's not about being numb to your emotions but learning to feel and be aware of them, to then react in a appropriate manner.
            And it only takes 100mins for the mindfulness practice to start to have a measurable effect.

        <h3>Meditation</h3>
    
        <p>
           I'm very happy to find somewhere that teaches mindfulness and gets you to read and try some of these things. I found the 2mins mindfulness practice that Meng recommends helps me to stop recenter and refocus. Learning code development is a big mountain to climb and it's very easy to feel overwhelmed, to learn how to stop catch yourself before you go too far down the rabbit hole is an amazing skill for you to be able to have.
